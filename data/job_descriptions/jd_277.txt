our strategy

fleetcor is a growth company and we employ a simple threeprong strategy for growing our business
 more customers we invest more than  million per year in sales and marketing predominately focused on new customer acquisition we continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as erp software providers telematics companies and banks we will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions
 more spend we seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures as such we have developed various beyond initiatives where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product as such a customer can buy more stuff without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with for example
 our fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow nonfuel purchases relevant to their business like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store so they can finish the paint job
 our toll tag customers can use their invehicle rfid tags to make other on the go purchases like parking fuel and fastfood for our customers these product extensions reduce payment friction saving them time and operational headaches for fleetcor these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products appeal and applicability to previouslyunserved customer segments eg nontoll urban dwellers we also create new product offerings developed internally or in conjunction with partners to crosssell to our existing customer base
 more geographies we continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships
