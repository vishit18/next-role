the company you ll join

at carta we create owners and make private markets liquid

we live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they ve managed to save from their paychecks
our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack payroll to the equity stack
by making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll we can create more owners

at carta we are helpful transparent fair and kind
we are relentless executors unconventional thinkers and masters of our craft
