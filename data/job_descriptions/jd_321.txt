about rora 

roras vision is a labor market where workers are as informed and as confident as recruiters are when they negotiate central to this vision are rora career advisors who inform advise and help our clients negotiate new job offers promotions new projects and more

we are a profitable business but there is a deeper purpose to rora than making money

we recognize that negotiating is a privilege rather than simply become agents for the most wealthy clients our mission is to democratize this privilege by educating those who dont know they can negotiate and supporting them we do this through a nonprofit arm we are launching in 

there are millions of hardworking and talented professionals who are afraid to ask their employer for what they deserve there are even more who dont understand the complex hr system and recruiting practices businesses operate on critical information to achieve anything you ask for

this system has been designed for workers to be disadvantaged compared to their employers workers can never expect to be as knowledgable or experienced as companies are because companies employ full time staff to understand the market and negotiate with our guidance the information assymetry can be evened out and candidates can have more mutually beneficial and meaningful conversations with their potential employers to ultimately arrive at the best decision for the right next move in their career
